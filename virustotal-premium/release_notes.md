#### The following enhancements have been made to the VirusTotal Premium Connector in version 1.1.2:

- The file enrichment playbook File > VirusTotal Premium > Enrichment optionally uploads the file and compute enrichment summary to VirusTotal Premium.
- A new configurable option now uploads or skips the file upload to VirusTotal Premium. A global variable virus_total_premium_upload_file when set to true uploads the file to VirusTotal Premium and skips the upload when set to false.
- Enhanced the enrichment playbooks to better manage responses from VirusTotal Premium.
